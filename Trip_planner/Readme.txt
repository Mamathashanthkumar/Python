This project calculates the trip expense per person. code trip_planner.py should be invoked as

 trip_planner.py <file for common expense file1> <file for drinking expense file2>
 
This is funny planner used for personal purpose, mainly built to play around the python dictionary.
We go for trips in gang, so we note down the common expenditures in a file1(it can be any name),as and when 
the person spends the data in file grows like 

person1 100
person2 200

So all the members in trip  should be regitered atleast once in this file and python builds the dictory of name of 
the person v/s money spent by the person.
Since not everyone drinks, drinking is maintained in separate file and all drinkers should be mentioned atleast once same as common expense.
With these two files provided, it calculates total expense, expense per person as below.
